create ADD_CHARACTER_PROFILE reducer for using response from API endpoint



SPENCE THE INDISPENSABLE
1) I want narration charType to automatically apply itself, hopefully without any rendering
2) I want speech types to automatically attempt a prediction when it becomes their turn
3) Pointers in tidying up


Snippets need to show the text that they match (save the text to the snippets?)

Need to have somewhere for adding more character profiles

Backend is not actually adding snippets to the DB
(Not bad for right now since it's easier to test without it doing that)

Need to automatically try for prediction when the currently highlighted pre snippet
is a speech type

Need button for marking current block as done, and pulling in next block

Animate the square around the current speech, to move to surround the next speech after selected
