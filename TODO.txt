!!!Pay attention to notification on Github for problem with Ser Waymar Royce being split up

// there's some duplication to the Snippets list going on after I added this
// maybe it's re-rendering something inside reducer for currentBook 'ADD_SNIPPET'
// and the passive to run stuff is going


Last chosen character goes to bottom of list (not top because it's easier to see the bottom
while you're looking at the pre snippets below the character list)



reset a given block. delete all snippets for it, and reset the other stuff to null



Snippets Styling
- more standout text color inside bars
- shorter bars in height
- bulma header style for title "Snippets"



CharacterList functionality
- pop up latest confirmed characters to top of list (don't change them any other way)


Nice to have -
Instead of going at a time, do a 'Pre script analysis'
    - locate all possible verbs that might indicate speech
    - locate all possible names (and have a little tooltip on highlight that lets you add it as a new name or
        add as an alias)


in the withWsMatchers -> have it check against multiple matches, so you can
    generate dynamic stuff, for example a NAR() wouldnt match
    if it came out for NAR(whatever here), but there could be cases where we
    want it to match anything there, so it might be easier to have it just create
    all the variations and pass it to an array for it to check against all of em

Show % of the book done

BRAINSTORM:
    insteaf of hard coded strings to match the objects, why not have functions instead?

Have a way that we can test some withWsMatchers that I'm unsure of? like it'll
send a suggestion but
2 classes of suggestions (sure ones, and possibilities)

get rid of anything not of arrangeComplete for the preSnippetArrangement?
it seems like the only truly useful ones are the complete ones. got a lot of incorrect
hits for the others


Refactor to use Electron instead of Express backend

Checkbox (marked true by default) for confirming you want narration types
automatically just marked as narration

Need button for confirming current block as done, and pulling in next block


% based suggestions (we're X% sure this is right)






READ: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html,
for better patterns hopefully using Redux
Nice to have but too much work ATM:
    factor out currentBlockWorkingOn. it's not necessary for the frontend
TRAINING MODEL
Pre scan all verbs for past tense, ask if they look like synonyms to indicate
somebody having uttered something




Toggleable logger depending by type.

LATERS
UAT test for deleting book by NAME
clicking on X near name confirms you want to delete it

Reachers
Animate the square around the current speech, to move to surround the next speech after selected
