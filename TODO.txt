Fix error when nearly last pre snippet is only one available

Need to have somewhere for adding more character profiles

Backend is not actually adding snippets to the DB
(Not bad for right now since it's easier to test without it doing that)

Still need to calculate removing of the preSnippets properly and adding
them to the snippets

Need to automatically try for prediction when the currently highlighted pre snippet
is a speech type
