Edit a speaker of a Snippet
(also search for the preSnippet and change the confirmed name)

reset a given block. delete all snippets for it, and reset the other stuff to null

label mode vs predict via ML mode



add ability to test accuracy given a hand labeled set
add loading symbol for requesting nameSuggestion (custom/nlp comp or google cloud)

add to README.md how to setup config file for google cloud NLP

add appropriate logging for narrationTextToGCNLP
- sentence sentence sent
- entities found (filtered down to important keys)
- tokens found (filtered down to important keys)
- which matcher

on a new block load, send first pre snippet for prediction, speech or narration


add caveat for triple worded names not being good at detecting name in sentence (until nlp comp ugrades that)

add a separate logging for all suggestion results
- what pattern matched, what name - analyze later which are most accurate


make google language api option only available if they mark that they have a .json key file

Snippets Styling
- more standout text color inside bars
- shorter bars in height
- bulma header style for title "Snippets"



CharacterList functionality
- pop up latest confirmed characters to top of list (don't change them any other way)


Nice to have -
Instead of going at a time, do a 'Pre script analysis'
    - locate all possible verbs that might indicate speech
    - locate all possible names (and have a little tooltip on highlight that lets you add it as a new name or
        add as an alias)


in the withWsMatchers -> have it check against multiple matches, so you can
    generate dynamic stuff, for example a NAR() wouldnt match
    if it came out for NAR(whatever here), but there could be cases where we
    want it to match anything there, so it might be easier to have it just create
    all the variations and pass it to an array for it to check against all of em

Show % of the book done

BRAINSTORM:
    insteaf of hard coded strings to match the objects, why not have functions instead?

Have a way that we can test some withWsMatchers that I'm unsure of? like it'll
send a suggestion but
2 classes of suggestions (sure ones, and possibilities)

get rid of anything not of arrangeComplete for the preSnippetArrangement?
it seems like the only truly useful ones are the complete ones. got a lot of incorrect
hits for the others


Refactor to use Electron instead of Express backend

Checkbox (marked true by default) for confirming you want narration types
automatically just marked as narration

Need button for confirming current block as done, and pulling in next block


% based suggestions (we're X% sure this is right)






READ: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html,
for better patterns hopefully using Redux
Nice to have but too much work ATM:
    factor out currentBlockWorkingOn. it's not necessary for the frontend
TRAINING MODEL
Pre scan all verbs for past tense, ask if they look like synonyms to indicate
somebody having uttered something




Toggleable logger depending by type.

LATERS
UAT test for deleting book by NAME
clicking on X near name confirms you want to delete it

Reachers
Animate the square around the current speech, to move to surround the next speech after selected
