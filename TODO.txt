!!!Pay attention to notification on Github for problem with Ser Waymar Royce being split up

FIRST PRIORITY
GET NEXT BLOCK

Nice to have -
Instead of going at a time, do a 'Pre script analysis'
    - locate all possible verbs that might indicate speech
    - locate all possible names (and have a little tooltip on highlight that lets you add it as a new name or
        add as an alias)


in the withWsMatchers -> have it check against multiple matches, so you can
    generate dynamic stuff, for example a NAR() wouldnt match
    if it came out for NAR(whatever here), but there could be cases where we
    want it to match anything there, so it might be easier to have it just create
    all the variations and pass it to an array for it to check against all of em


Have a way that we can test some withWsMatchers that I'm unsure of? like it'll
send a suggestion but
2 classes of suggestions (sure ones, and possibilities)

get rid of anything not of arrangeComplete for the preSnippetArrangement?
it seems like the only truly useful ones are the complete ones. got a lot of incorrect
hits for the others


Checkbox (marked true by default) for confirming you want narration types
automatically just marked as narration

Need button for confirming current block as done, and pulling in next block


% based suggestions (we're X% sure this is right)






READ: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html,
for better patterns hopefully using Redux
Nice to have but too much work ATM:
    factor out currentBlockWorkingOn. it's not necessary for the frontend
TRAINING MODEL
Pre scan all verbs for past tense, ask if they look like synonyms to indicate
somebody having uttered something




Toggleable logger depending by type.

LATERS
UAT test for deleting book by NAME
clicking on X near name confirms you want to delete it

Reachers
Animate the square around the current speech, to move to surround the next speech after selected
